# Word-Guess-Game

## Deployed website: https://mrrwmix.github.io/Word-Guess-Game/

## Description of the Problem

Creating a hangman-style game with pure JavaScript. It displays the letters guessed, has gifs, and plays music once you guess correctly or incorrectly.

## How I Solved It

First, I came up with a theme. Then, I worked on creating functions to record wins, letters guessed, and more. Added styling and songs towards the end of development. 

## Technical approach

Setting up the basic page first, then working on javascript, and lastly polishing up with styling.
